What Does it Do?
the buttons on the launchpad correlate to a specific country (not all buttons are used)
when a button is pressed a call is made to an api for the top song and artist of that song in the respective country
a call is also made to the colors that make up the song's designated palette in the api
and the background changes gradients based on the color palette of that country's song
